\label{bubble}

In this experiment, you will determine some properties of short-lived particles by analysing photographs from a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber.  The experiment is based around measurements of film taken from the bubble chamber at CERN particle physics laboratory near Geneva.

Bubble chambers played an important part in discovering particles whose existence played an important part in establishing the quark model in the 1950s--1970s. They are no longer in use at accelerator centres, having been superseded by the faster modern electronic detectors.  However, a bubble chamber is currently being used during the search for dark matter (WIMPs).

\subsection{Background}

The bubble chamber, invented by Donald Glaser in 1952, consists of a tank of unstable (superheated) transparent liquid.  Hydrogen is often used\footnote{Hydrogen was popular as it has the simplest nucleus; other nuclei presented problems such as, `Did the beam particle hit a neutron or a proton?'}, at a temperature of about \SI{30}{K}.  This liquid is very sensitive to the passage of {\bf charged} particles, which initiate boiling as a result of the energy they deposit by ionizing the atoms as they force their way through the liquid.
Bubbles are formed along the paths of the charged particles, and these tracks of bubbles can be photographed.

\subsection{How to read bubble chamber tracks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Beam particles whose tracks do NOT remain parallel all the way through the picture must have collided with a proton in a hydrogen atom.
\item All the paths of charged particles (and we only see charged particle paths) are curved by the magnetic field.
\item Positively charged particles' paths curve one way, negatively charged particles' paths the other.  (Normally, it is not necessary to be told which way the field is pointing---the picture already contains the answer. The little curly tracks are produced by electrons which are knocked out of the atoms by charged particles passing by.)
\item The momentum of a particle is proportional to the radius of curvature of the track in the bubble chamber. 
\item When a particle has used up its energy making bubbles, it stops. So its range is a measure of its energy.  In practice, this is useful for identifying protons that have received only a gentle blow from the beam particle, thus not having enough energy to get all the way to the edge of the chamber.
\item Other particles (for example pions) may stop; but if they do, they decay in a characteristic way which tells us that they are pions. In such a case, we would know the mass $m$ and its momentum $p$ from the curvature of the track; the energy can then be calculated using: $E^{2} = p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$.
\end{itemize}

So much for charged particles.  Neutral particles do NOT leave trails of bubbles.  However, we can still sometimes glean some clues about their properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item An unstable neutral particle may decay before it leaves the bubble chamber into a pair of lighter particles - one positive and one negative - leaving an easily recognizable letter V (or vee) shape.
\item If the tracks from the vee happen to cross again, downstream, the line joining the crossing position to the decay position (the V) points back to the origin of the neutral particle.
\item An uncharged particle is often produced when an unstable charged particle decays--usually into a charged particle of the same sign and one or more neutral particles. This shows up in the bubble chamber as a kink (a sudden change into a more curved track).
\item The energy and momentum of the uncharged particle(s) which leave at the kink can be inferred by conservation laws from the tracks we do see.
\item If you want to examine the picture of a collision very carefully – to find small angle kinks, for example – it is a good idea to print the picture and look at it from a very low angle.
\end{itemize}

%It is often possible to identify the kind of particle from their characteristic decay signatures.  This is a case of visual pattern recognition.

%At the LHC, where the events will have hundreds of particles in the final state, imaginative systems of electronic detectors and software have been designed to do this at incredibly high data-acquisition rates.
